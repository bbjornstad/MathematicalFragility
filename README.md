# MathematicalFragility
A repository for a research project studying a new mathematically rigorous conception of fragility via methods from Stochastic Analysis (specifically Random Walks)

## An Update
After a long period of time, I have decided to return to this to give a bit more overview of this project, mostly for my own sake!

This project encompasses a few separate pieces. First, there are the modeling scripts, which I used to generate and analyze random walks governed by various probability distributions. I gathered these results in order to guide my intuitions about the proofs which I aimed to hash out as part of this research project.

A documentation of my results can be found in the `latex` folder, which contains a decently lengthy summary of my results as well as some of the proofs that I managed to figure out before the submission deadline with Northwestern's Office of Undergraduate Research.
